### Every Roll Matters

In Open Legend, every action roll should drive the story in a new direction, for better or worse. A failed roll should not let the story stagnate, nor should a failure be easily negated by another character's successful roll.

<div class="table-centered"></div>

| **The Action Roll**  |
| - |
| Roll 1d20 + attribute dice (all dice explode) |


| If the action roll... | then the result is... |
| :- | :- |
| equals or exceeds the Challenge Rating, | the player succeeds. |
| is less than the Challenge Rating *(GM's Choice)*, | the player succeeds with a twist. <br /> **- OR -** <br /> the player fails, but the story progresses. |


### Interpreting Success with a Twist

When a player fails an action roll, the GM may allow the player to succeed with a twist. The player gets what they wanted originally, but there is an unintended consequence or unexpected cost. Example twists include:

- **Put a character in danger**
- **Expend a resource**
- **Make an enemy or lose a friend**
- **Overlook an important detail**
- **Waste time**
- **Attract attention**
- **Find something you weren't looking for**


### Challenge Ratings by Difficulty

| Difficulty | Challenge Rating | Example Actions |
| :-: | :-: | :------ |
| Everyday | 10 | leap a 5' gap, climb a surface with ledges, break down a household door, haggle a simple merchant for a discount |
| Challenging | 15 | climb a rough surface, catch the drift of a text in an unfamiliar language, break down a strong wooden door |
| Heroic | 20 | climb a smooth surface, leap a 15' gap, translate a text in an unfamiliar language, convince a neutral party to take a risk for you |
| Epic | 25 | translate a text in an alien language, break down an iron door |
| Legendary | 30 | leap a 25' chasm, climb a flat surface, befriend an enemy with a vendetta against you |


### The Core Mechanic in Combat

The core mechanic of Open Legend is meant to inspire creativity in players and GMs so that the story always moves forward and so that no dice roll ever feels wasted. However, in combat, players typically make many more action rolls than usual, so the GM may feel overwhelmed if they are constantly trying to come up with new interpretations of a failed roll on the fly.

Some GMs might love that kind of challenge, and for 
___
them, **the core mechanic can be used in combat in the same way it is in every other part of the game**. GMs who want something a little more streamlined **may use the following modification** to the usual core mechanic in combat:

<div class="table-centered"></div>

| **The Action Roll for Attacks**  |
| - |
| Roll 1d20 + attribute dice (all dice explode) |

<div class="table-force-left-col-width-480"></div>

| If the action roll... | then the result is... <div style="min-width: 500px;"></div> |
| :- | :-  |
| equals or exceeds the Challenge Rating, | the player succeeds. |
| is less than the <br /> Challenge Rating, | The GM and the PC both choose 1: <br /> <br />&bull; Deal 3 damage <br /> &bull; Inflict 1 bane of power level <= 3 <br /> &bull; Move 10' w/o opportunity attacks |


### Taking Your Turn


On their turn, each character is allowed one major action, one move action, and any number of minor actions (though only one minor action of the same type). In lieu of taking any of these actions, a character may choose to take one focus action on their turn.

| Each turn, characters may take... | Or... |
| :- | :- |
| &bull; 1 Major Action* <br /> &bull; 1 Move Action <br /> &bull; Any number of minor actions | &bull; 1 Focus Action |


### Major Actions

-   Make a damaging attack
-   Make a bane attack
-   Invoke a boon
-   Assist an Ally
-   Take an extra move action

### Move Actions

-   Move your speed
-   Take special movement
-   Resist banes

### Focus Actions

- Superior Action - Make any one action roll with advantage 1
- Charge - Move up to double speed and make one melee attack at disadvantage 1

### Minor Actions

A character may take any number of minor actions on their turn, but cannot take more than one of the same type of minor action. Minor actions include the following:

-   Make an opportunity attack
-   Sustain a boon
-   Draw or sheathe a weapon
-   Retrieve an item stored on your person
-   Make a Perception roll to observe your surroundings
-   Make a Learning roll to recall useful information
-   Open a door, chest, drawer, etc.

### Make a Damaging Attack

A damaging attack aims to reduce a foe’s hit points. 

1. **Determine attribute vs. defense.** Every attack consists of a single attribute roll that is compared to one of the target’s defenses.
1. **Choose a target.** The range of an attack depends on whether it is melee, ranged, or non-physical.
1. **Roll the attack.** Make an attribute roll. Deal damage equal to the amount that the roll exceeds the target’s defense. If the attack meets or exceeds the target's defense, it deals a minimum of three damage.


<div class="table-no-head"></div>

| |
| - |
| **Attack Roll Total** - **Target Defense** = **Damage Dealt** *(minimum of 3 on success)* |
| *(**Exceptional Success** - trigger a bane or disrupt concentration if total is 10 or more over defense)* |


### Make a Bane Attack

Instead of damaging a target, a bane attack can instead inflict a target with a bane. To inflict a bane, the attacker must have an appropriate attribute of at least the bane's power level, as detailed in the bane descriptions. While targets may be affected by multiple different banes, a target cannot be inflicted with a bane already in effect on it, unless specified in the bane's effect (*e.g. fatigued*).

1. **Determine attribute vs. defense.** The bane descriptions indicate which attributes can be used to inflict a bane as well as the targeted defense.
1. **Choose a target.** Choosing targets and determining range for bane attacks is no different from damaging attacks, including multi-targeting options. Note that banes invoked with Agility or Might require a weapon or natural attack, and their range is thus limited.
1. **Roll the attack.** Make an action roll using the appropriate attribute. If the total equals or exceeds the target's defense score, the target suffers the bane.



### Invoke a Boon

Boons can be invoked in order to aid allies. To invoke a boon, the acting character must have an attribute of at least the boon's power level, as detailed in the boon descriptions. 

1. **Choose a target.** Choosing targets and determining range for boon invocations is identical to the process for damaging attacks, including multi-targeting options. If a boon is later sustained, that use of the sustain action persists the boon for all targets affected by the original invocation.
1. **Roll to invoke.** Make an action roll using the appropriate attribute, as determined by the boon description.
1. **Determine power level.** Some boons only possess a single power level, while others can be invoked at multiple power levels. The Boon Challenge Rating Table indicates the highest power level at which the boon can be invoked based on the action roll total. Regardless of the roll, a character cannot invoke a boon at a power level greater than the attribute used to invoke the boon. The roll fails if it does not meet the Challenge Rating of the boon's lowest power level.

### Defenses and Hit Points

<div class="table-no-body table-no-stripes table-even-header"></div>

| Toughness = 10 + Fortitude + Will |
| - |
| |

**Toughness** protects you from attacks that test your endurance, bodily health, sturdiness, and survivability. For example, foes attempting to poison you, drain your life force, or stun you will target your toughness.

<div class="table-no-body table-no-stripes table-even-header"></div>

| Guard = 10 + Agility + Might + Armor |
| - |
| |

**Guard** protects you from attacks that can either be dodged, deflected, or directly withstood via raw physical power. Your enemies would need to overcome your guard in order to hit you with a grenade, shoot you with an arrow, or smash you with a maul.

<div class="table-no-body table-no-stripes table-even-header"></div>

| Resolve = 10 + Presence + Will  |
| - |
| |

**Resolve** represents your character's ability to resist mental domination and stand brave in the face of danger. Enemies who wish to charm you, deceive you with illusions, or frighten you must target your resolve.
