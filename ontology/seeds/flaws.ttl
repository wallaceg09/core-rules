<ol:Vengeful>  a     ol:Flaw ;
        ol:effectIs  "You let no slight go unpunished. While some might be able to shake off an insult from a tavern drunk, you take it as a personal assault that demands satisfaction. The more severe the crime, the greater the vengeance you will mete out." ;

<ol:Phobia>  a       ol:Flaw ;
        ol:effectIs  "You are terrified and incapable of rational thought when you are presented with the object of your fear.

        ol:nameIs    "Phobia" .

<ol:Addiction>  a    ol:Flaw ;
        ol:effectIs  "The roll of the dice, the smoke of the Black Lotus, or the escape of the virtual reality machine. Whether your addiction is physical, mental, or social, the effect is generally the same: you've got an itch that you need to scratch, and you'll sometimes do reckless or atrocious things to make sure that you can get your fix.

<ol:Cowardly>  a     ol:Flaw ;
        ol:effectIs  "You have honed self-preservation into a way of life, and you will do almost anything to avoid danger, pain, and death. Sometimes, the situation at hand and the pumping of adrenaline will lead you to perform acts that appear courageous, but sooner or later your cowardly nature will emerge. You are easy to intimidate and you will almost assuredly crack under interrogation. In combat, you can still choose to fight, but you will attempt to distance yourself as much as possible from harm's way, even if it means leaving an ally in a tough spot." ;

        ol:effectIs  "You disdain combat and bloodshed of any kind, and will generally do whatever possible to avoid it. You can decide the extent of your pacifism.

<ol:Dimwitted>  a    ol:Flaw ;
        ol:effectIs  "You aren't the sharpest tack in the box. It's not just that you weren't gifted with skill in academia, it's that you pick up on things pretty slowly overall.

<ol:Literal+Minded>  a  ol:Flaw ;

<ol:Naive>  a        ol:Flaw ;
        ol:effectIs  "Whether you are innocent, uninformed, or inexperienced, the results are the same: you are pretty gullible. You get to define the scope of your naivety. For example, maybe you're a greenhorn from a big city on the east coast, so you are unlearned in the ways of the Wild West. Or maybe your memory was completely wiped out a few weeks ago and you are relearning the rules of civilization, thus your naivety presents itself much more universally." ;

<ol:Absent>  a       ol:Flaw ;
        ol:effectIs  "You live with your head in the clouds. You might just be ditzy, or maybe you just spend your time contemplating loftier matters.

<ol:Overt>  a        ol:Flaw ;
        ol:effectIs  "You have a strong aversion to subterfuge, legerdemain, and smooth talking.

<ol:Bloodlust>  a    ol:Flaw ;
        ol:effectIs  "Battle isn't just a way of life, it is *the* way of life.

You are prone to starting fights when they aren't necessary and prolonging them even after the enemy has surrendered." ;
        ol:nameIs    "Bloodlust" .

<ol:Greedy>  a       ol:Flaw ;
        ol:effectIs  "You can't help it: you just like *things*. Money, gems, items of power - they beckon you at every turn and you'll often take great risks and maybe even betray your allies if the monetary reward is great enough.

<ol:Proud>  a        ol:Flaw ;
        ol:effectIs  "Some call it an inflated ego. Others call it conceit. But you know that you really are just that good. The rabble are inferior, and you're not afraid to let them know.
